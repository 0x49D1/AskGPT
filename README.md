# ChatGPT Reader Plugin for KOReader

Welcome to the ChatGPT Reader Plugin for KOReader! With this plugin, you can highlight text in your e-books and ask ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI, to answer questions about the content. This can be a great way to deepen your understanding of the material and learn new things!

## Getting Started

To use this plugin, you'll need to sign up for an API key from OpenAI. Once you have your API key, create a `api_key.lua` file in the following structure:

```lua
local API_KEY = {
  key = "your_api_key",
}

return API_KEY
```

## How To Use

To use the ChatGPT Reader Plugin, simply highlight the text that you want to ask a question about, and select "Ask ChatGPT" from the menu. The plugin will then send your highlighted text to the ChatGPT API, and display the answer to your question in a pop-up window.

I am currently using this on a jailbroken Kindle Paperwhite with KOReader installed.

I hope you enjoy using this plugin and that it enhances your e-reading experience. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let me know!
